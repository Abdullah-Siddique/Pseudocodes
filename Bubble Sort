Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm which will help you to sort an array inn ascending order.
Here you just have to do those things:

->Compare two neighboring items.
->If the first one is bigger, swap them.
->Do this for every pair, over and over, until everything is sorted.

Pseudocode:

for i from 0 to n-1:
  for j from 0 to n-1-i:
    if array[j] > array[j+1]:
      swap array[j] and array[j+1]
