Quick sort is a sorting algorithm which will help you to sort an array in ascending order.
Here you have to do those things:
->Pick a "pivot" item in an array.
->Put items smaller than the pivot on one side, and bigger items on the other.
->Repeat this process for both sides.

Pseudocode:
if list has more than 1 item:
  pick a pivot
  partition the list into two: smaller and bigger than the pivot
  quicksort the smaller list
  quicksort the bigger list
