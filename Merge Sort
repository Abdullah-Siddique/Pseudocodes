Merge sort is a sorting algorithm which will help you to sort an array in ascending order.
Here you have to do those things:
->Divide the list into two halves.
->Keep dividing until each piece is just one item.
->Merge the pieces back together in the correct order.

Pseudocode:
if list has more than 1 item:
  split list in two halves
  merge sort the first half
  merge sort the second half
  merge the two halves
