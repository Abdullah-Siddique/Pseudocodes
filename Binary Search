Binary search refers to find an element(any element you wish) in an array.
Here you have  to do:
->Look at the middle of a sorted list.
->If the item you're searching for is smaller, look in the left half.
->If it's bigger, look in the right half.
->Repeat until you find it.

Pseudocode:
while left <= right:
  middle = (left + right) // 2
  if array[middle] == target:
    return middle
  else if target < array[middle]:
    right = middle - 1
  else:
    left = middle + 1
return -1
