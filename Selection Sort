Selection sort is a sorting algorithm which will help you to sort an array in ascending order.
Here you have to do those things:
->Find the smallest item in the list.
->Swap it with the first item.
->Find the next smallest, and so on.

Pseudocode:
for i from 0 to n-1:
  smallest = i
  for j from i+1 to n-1:
    if array[j] < array[smallest]:
      smallest = j
  swap array[i] and array[smallest]
