Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm which will help you to sort an array in ascending order.
Here you just have to do those things:
->Start with the second item.
->Insert it into the correct spot in the already sorted part of the list.
->Repeat for all items.

Pseudocode:
for i from 1 to n-1:
  key = array[i]
  j = i - 1
  while j >= 0 and array[j] > key:
    array[j+1] = array[j]
    j = j - 1
  array[j+1] = key
